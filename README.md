#  PlantCLEF 2025 - Multi-Species Plant Identification

##  Overview

This repository contains my solution for the **PlantCLEF 2025** challenge hosted as part of **LifeCLEF 2025** and the **CVPR-FGVC workshop**. The task involves **multi-species plant identification** in **high-resolution vegetation quadrat images**.

A quadrat is a rectangular frame placed on the ground to define a fixed area for ecological sampling. Each image may contain **multiple plant species**, making this a **multi-label classification** problem with **fine-grained visual recognition** challenges and **environmental variability** (e.g., different lighting, angles, growth stages).

---

##  Objective

- Identify all plant species present in each image.
- Learn robust representations for fine-grained, multi-label classification.
- Explore hierarchical taxonomies and model uncertainty in species prediction.
